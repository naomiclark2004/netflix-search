My project is a Netflix search application.

Using a dataset of neflix's catalog, the user can search for movies and shows by director, title, and actor.

A function will search through the dataset and return information an all movies and tv shows that have the given director, title or actor in the dataset.

## Instructions:

To run the application simply enter into the command line:

    python app.py
